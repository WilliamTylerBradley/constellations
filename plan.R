# set on a sphere
# uniform-ish distribution for main stars and back ground stars
# poisson-ish distribution for constellations
# voronoi to collect points to constellations
# combine a few regions for interesting shapes
# delete a few for some gaps
# connect stars probabilistically, smaller distances = more likely
# don't connect if it crosses over a connection
# randomize star shape
